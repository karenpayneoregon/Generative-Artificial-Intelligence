# About

The following is a very simple example for using AI to create interfaces and classes in C# using GitHub Copilot and JetBrains ReSharper.

> **Note**
> Jetbrains ReSharper is a paid extension for Visual Studio. It is used here to move the generated code to proper folders and update the namespaces. Also, Jetbrains has a paid AI service which Karen has a ticket for.

Here we want to create

- A generic interface
- Customer class to implement above interface
- Both of the above get created in Program.cs using `Copilot`.

:heavy_check_mark: The interface are then moved using Jetbrain's ReSharper Visual Studio extension to proper folders.

:heavy_check_mark: During the ReSharper action Visual Studio kicks in and asked to update the namespace.
